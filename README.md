Mirmidon-toolbox
================

This toolbox is intended to find inspiration and reminders on specific work related to wave-ocean modelling. 

The value is not in the scripts or whatsoever you can find in that repo, but in your data. However instead of re-invent the wheel, I am pleased to share some stuff with you.

Do not hesitate to Pull/Request if you're interested in this stuff.
